# ProjectC

The ov notifier is an android application which calculates your department time. In order for that to happen it needs the time you need to be at your destination, your department location and the location of arrival.

This project is made as a second year high school project.

# Api

We use the 1313.nl api to calculate our routes but in order to manage data we also created our own. Our api's are documented at the docs folder or projectc.caslayoort.nl/docs .
----------------------
Note about the API functions:
If an API function requires a token and a user_id, the token must be generated from a login (/public/auth) with the account of the given user_id, or else
the function won't be executed.
